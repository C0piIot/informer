## Arquitecture
This is a standard Django application with normal views, an api with DRF and background jobs.
Key parts of the app are pluggable: 

- Background task processor: currently the only adapter implementation uses [dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/). Dramatiq itself supports redis, RabbitMQ and Amazon SQS (via a third party package)
- Storage of running communicatino flows and its logs
- Contact storage: currently standard django models
- Stats storage: currently using redis
